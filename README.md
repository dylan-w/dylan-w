### Career

I work as an Android Developer developing customer-centric mobile apps in the finance industry.

I enjoy taking part in all parts of the design cycle. I've collaborated with design teams to design the best user experience possible within a mobile app. In addition to creating visually appealing user interfaces base in Material Design, I also have experience ensuring W3C Accessibility compliance to that as many users as possible can experience an android app.

Within the app itself I have read up on Android best practices and architectural patterns to best utilize the Android ecosystem of Architectural Components and supporting libraries.

I also have experience ensuring code quality by setting up CI/CD processes in Github and Gitlab. I've set up code linters and git hook checks locally as well as in our CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality. I've also worked to design thorough testing within the app to guarantee required functionality of the app and speedup continuous delivery.

### Personal

In addition to professional work, I enjoy working on coding in free time and attempting coding challenges. I would love to figure out how to get involed in an open source project.

Hobbies away from the computer are hiking and cycling.
